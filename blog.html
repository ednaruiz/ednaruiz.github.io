    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Science Amid Atrocity: Rethinking Collaboration in Times of War</h1>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-m">
    The destruction of Gaza has not only cost countless civilian lives — it has also erased entire universities, laboratories, and libraries. Palestinian scientists and students, already facing decades of isolation, are now left with no institutions to return to. The <a href="https://www.ictp.it/news/2023/12/memoriam">death of Prof. Sufian Tayeh</a> , president of the Islamic University of Gaza and a respected physicist, symbolizes the silencing of a generation of researchers.
    Meanwhile, global institutions such as American universities, CERN, and the Max Planck Society continue collaborations with Israel, ignoring that Palestinian contributions to physics — from Birzeit’s graduate programs to the Palestine Academy of Science and Technology — are being systematically erased. This selective blindness normalizes a science that integrates one side fully while destroying the other.
    As astrophysicists, we cannot separate collaboration from responsibility. To call for a ceasefire and the suspension of ties with institutions complicit in violence is not only a moral stance — it is a scientific necessity. A science that excludes justice cannot claim to be universal.
  </p>
  <br>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
The ongoing devastation in Gaza has led to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Entire families, communities, and universities have been destroyed. Thousands of civilians — including students, teachers, and children — have been killed. For the Palestinian scientific community, already fragile under decades of occupation, the bombardment has meant the erasure of laboratories, the silencing of classrooms, and the forced exile of intellectual life.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
As astrophysicists, we are trained to study phenomena of enormous energy and scale, but we cannot remain silent when real human catastrophes unfold on Earth. Science is not immune from politics. The values of inquiry, cooperation, and truth-seeking require an ethical foundation: without justice, science risks becoming a tool of power rather than a collective pursuit of knowledge.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
Israel has established itself as a significant actor in global astrophysics, contributing to space missions, high-energy astrophysics, and international collaborations. Yet these achievements stand in stark contradiction with the systemic destruction of Palestinian lives and institutions. The reality is that there are no comparable platforms for Palestinian researchers; their contributions are routinely excluded, their institutions underfunded or bombed, and their access to international networks blocked.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Palestinian contributions to physics exist, but they have been persistently marginalized:</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
    The <b>Islamic University of Gaza</b>, once home to active programs in physics and engineering, was bombed on October 10–11, 2023, destroying core facilities and libraries 
    (<a href="https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2023-10-10-islamic-university-of-gaza/">Scholars at Risk, 2023</a>). 
    Its president, physicist <b>Prof. Sufian Tayeh</b>, a respected researcher in optics, was killed with his family in December 2023 
    (<a href="https://pomeps.org/the-hidden-war-on-higher-education-unmasking-the-educide-in-gaza">POMEPS, 2023</a>).
  </li>
  <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
    <b>Birzeit University</b> in the West Bank has cultivated graduate education in physics and mathematics. In 2017, it hosted the 
    <b>Palestinian Advanced Physics School (PAPS)</b>, gathering over 50 master’s students for lectures on cosmology, SESAME accelerator physics, and quantum theory 
    (<a href="https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/90393">WAFA, 2017</a>). 
    Yet its community faces travel bans, raids, and academic isolation 
    (<a href="https://www.birzeit.edu/en/news/birzeit-university-hosts-palestinian-advanced-physics-school">Birzeit University</a>).
  </li>
  <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
    The <b>Palestine Academy for Science and Technology</b> has struggled to maintain international partnerships under occupation, despite efforts to connect Palestinian researchers with global collaborations 
    (<a href="https://www.past.ps/">PAST</a>).
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
The contrast is devastating: while one side launches satellites and secures major roles in observatories, the other struggles to keep electricity running long enough to complete a thesis. The destruction of these institutions represents not only a local tragedy but an impoverishment of global science. Talent is not confined by borders, but opportunity can be destroyed by bombs.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
And yet, <b>international scientific institutions remain complicit by their silence or active collaboration</b>. Leading American universities continue to host joint projects with Israeli institutions 
(<a href="https://tau.gs.columbia.edu/content/about-dual-degree-program">Columbia–Tel Aviv Exchange</a>). 
<b>CERN</b> has maintained Israel’s privileged status as a full member state 
(<a href="https://international-relations.web.cern.ch/stakeholder-relations/states/israel">CERN Member States</a>), 
even while Palestinian universities are reduced to rubble. The <b>Max Planck Society</b> highlights Israeli collaborations on its official pages 
(<a href="https://www.mpg.de/israel">MPI Israel cooperation</a>) 
while ignoring the obliteration of Palestinian academic life. This selective blindness normalizes a situation in which one side of the conflict is fully integrated into global science, while the other is deliberately erased.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
We must confront this imbalance. Collaboration cannot be separated from responsibility. Continuing “business as usual” with institutions complicit in war crimes legitimizes the silencing of an entire people. To call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire is not only a moral obligation — it is a scientific one, because science that excludes justice is incomplete.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
The astrophysics community must take a stand: pause collaborations with institutions involved in systemic violence, amplify Palestinian voices, and demand space for their contributions in our field. Only then can we claim to live up to the universalism we so often invoke when we speak of the stars.
