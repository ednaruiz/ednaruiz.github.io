    <p class="mb-4">I am a postdoc at the <strong>Gamma-ray group of LAPP/CNRS</strong> in Annecy, France. My main interest is the observation of <strong>Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs)</strong> at very high energies (&gt;100 GeV). I am currently a member of the <strong>LST-CTAO collaboration</strong>, profiting from the largest IACT in the world to detect GRBs.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Before this, I was deeply involved in the operations of the <strong>H.E.S.S. telescopes</strong> as Science Operations Manager and member of the GRB group. I was also a member of the <strong>HAWC and SWGO collaborations</strong>, where I developed tools for the analysis of transient events, event reconstruction, and detailed (sometimes fancy) simulations.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">More About Me</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">I am from Mexico City but spent most of my childhood summers in Chiapas — growing wild and scared of insects with my cousins and brothers.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I did my bachelor's at UNAM, where I got involved early with the <strong>HAWC Observatory</strong>, which was being built near a volcano in Mexico. I became captivated by it and its mission.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In 2016, I was a summer student at CERN, studying jet production in heavy ion collisions — an experience that shaped my path, but also helped me realize I wanted to study the universe through astrophysical messengers instead.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In 2017, I moved to Heidelberg to begin my PhD on GRBs. After a year of mostly upper limits, everything changed with the detection of <strong>GRB 180720B</strong> in 2018. From there: fun and chaos.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I spent my free time mostly at home, enjoying the simple things of life like toddler tantrums. My hobby is <em>having new hobbies</em> (hello ADHD). At this time these are mostly photography, DJing, and hydroponics. I enjoy a lot cooking, the one hobby that seems to stick. </p>
